Great! Here's a suggested route map to accomplish your task:

1. **Data Exploration and Filtering**:
   - Start by downloading the company dataset from Kaggle.
   - Use Python libraries such as Pandas to explore the dataset and filter out the useful data based on your requirements.

2. **Setting up Apache Airflow**:
   - Install Apache Airflow on your system. You can use pip to install it: `pip install apache-airflow`.
   - Initialize the Airflow database: `airflow db init`.
   - Start the Airflow web server and the scheduler: `airflow webserver --port 8080` and `airflow scheduler`.

3. **Creating Airflow DAG**:
   - Define an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that represents your data pipeline.
   - In the DAG, create tasks for each step of your pipeline (e.g., data extraction, transformation, loading into the database).
   - Use PythonOperator to execute Python code within your DAG tasks.

4. **Data Loading into Database**:
   - Choose the database system you want to use (Excel, SQL, PL/SQL, MongoDB).
   - Write Python code within your Airflow tasks to load the filtered data into the chosen database.
   - For SQL databases, you can use libraries like SQLAlchemy or psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, cx_Oracle for Oracle databases, etc.
   - For MongoDB, you can use PyMongo to interact with the MongoDB database.

5. **Testing and Execution**:
   - Test your Airflow DAG locally to ensure that it executes successfully.
   - Once you're confident in your DAG, deploy it to your Airflow production environment.

6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Monitor your Airflow DAG to ensure that it runs smoothly and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

By following these steps, you should be able to use Apache Airflow to create a data pipeline that filters useful data from the company dataset, processes it using Python code within Airflow tasks, and stores it in the database of your choice. Let me know if you need further clarification on any step!
